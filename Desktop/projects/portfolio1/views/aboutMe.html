<p class="aboutMe">A few years ago I was hand picked to be the Internal Content Developer for SecurityMetrics, and that meant I had to learn some programming languages! One of my main responsibilities was to program and maintain a new internal Wiki system for the company. I had to take apart the mess of a wiki they currently had, sift through the wreckage to find any salvageable pieces, and then gather all the updated and required documents and files form each department. After that, I learned some programming languages and started to develop the new internal Wiki for the company! I have always loved learning new languages, but I hadn't even thought about all of the different computer and programming languages out there. I picked up on the language needed for the Wiki pretty quickly, and I excelled at my work. The porject that I was given 6-8 months to complete, was finished in 6-8 weeks! I got a taste of programming and I knew I wanted more! Over the next year, I spent most of my free-time doing online tutorials learning the basics of quite a few new languages. I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in web development or web design, so in January of 2017 I started the 3 month immersive Full-Stack Web Development boot camp at DevMountain in Provo, UT. There, I learned about ten languages and used them to develop full-stack web applications. I completed the course at the beginning of April, and now I'm on the search for a full-time position in web development or web design.
